# Data Visualization of New Chich Ecommerce website
As a data scientist my mission is to visualize the data in order to evolve the business by knowing which subcategory of shoes is the most and the least appreciated 
by their customers so that I can focus on the needs of their customers and get rid of the other subcategories of shoes that don't generate huge income.

When it comes to e-commerce marketing strategies, data visualization is important because it allows the team to conceptualize and capture large amounts of information. 
we can extract complex analyzes from our website and competitor sites and turn them into easy-to-read graphics. 
These diagrams are not only important in helping the team understand where the strengths of the strategy lie, but also where there is room for improvement.

the steps that has been followed on this project are:
- Access to the 'DATA.WORLD' REST API of the New Chic Website.
- Recovering the dataset, cleaning, and exploration in RStudio.
- Applying some basic descriptive statistics.
- Probability sampling (in marketing we use stratified sampling).
- Creating the different plots using ggplot & plotly... packages.
